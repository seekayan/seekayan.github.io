<td align="left"><h2>Abstract <br /></h2>
<p>The inner workings of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) remain largely a mystery to humans, despite their ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance in image classification tasks. This lack of interpretability has sparked interest in developing methods to explain the workings of these deep models in order to improve their trustworthiness. Our team has proposed models that can explain the predictions made by a pre-trained CNN in terms of automatically discovered concepts, as well as the first explainable by design supervised domain adapted classifier. These developments represent important steps towards increasing the interpretability of deep learning models and improving their trustworthiness.<br /></p>

<h3>Meta-learning for Few-shot Learning</h3>

<td align="left"><h2>Abstract <br /></h2>
<p>Meta-learning has emerged as a promising direction in machine learning, particularly for learning under constrained resource settings such as few-shot learning. Popular approaches to meta-learning either involve learning a generalizable initial model or a generic parametric optimizer through batch episodic training. Our research on meta-learning focuses on analyzing the effect of task importance on learning dynamics, handling shifts in the support and query sets, and understanding the limitations of meta-learners such as MAML, MetaSGD, Protonets, and Meta-LSTM++.<br /></p>

<h3>Zero-shot Learning</h3>
<table class="imgtable"><tr><td>
<img src="images/sabr.jpg" alt="alt text" width="275px" height="250px" />&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"><h2>Abstract <br /></h2>
<p>Zero shot learning (ZSL) is a machine learning approach that aims to recognize unseen classes by exploiting the semantic relationships between seen and unseen classes. However, ZSL algorithms often face two major problems: the hubness problem and bias towards the seen classes. Existing ZSL methods typically only address one of these problems in either the conventional or generalized ZSL setting. Our initial work attempted to overcome both of these challenges, and we are now working on developing zero-shot learning approaches for recognizing words in hand-written historical documents. By addressing these challenges, our goal is to improve the effectiveness of ZSL algorithms in a variety of real-world applications.<br /></p>

<h3>Generative Modeling</h3>
<table class="imgtable"><tr><td>
<img src="images/pdg.png" alt="alt text" width="275px" height="300px" />&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"><h2>Abstract <br /></h2>
<p>Despite the impressive capabilities of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in modeling data distributions, training them remains a challenging task. One factor that contributes to this difficulty is the non-intuitive nature of the GAN loss curves, which make it difficult to evaluate the progress of training. We investigate the challenges with existing methods of evaluation and propose a theoretically grounded measure to identify GAN convergence. Our proposed measure provides a more objective way to evaluate GAN training progress, allowing for better control and more efficient training of GANs.<br /></p>

<h3>Transfer Learning and Domain Adaptation</h3>
<table class="imgtable"><tr><td>
<img src="images/tl.png" alt="alt text" width="275px" height="300px" />&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"><h2>Abstract <br /></h2>
<p>The two main challenges in performing feature transfer are the heterogeneity of features and the lack of correspondence between data points in different domains. Our research into transfer learning and domain adaptation aims to address these challenges and bridge the gap between diverse source and target domains. By studying these techniques, we aim to improve the transferability of features and better align the data points in different domains, ultimately improving the performance of machine learning models.<br /></p>
