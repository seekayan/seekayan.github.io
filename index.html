<h2>About the lab</h2>
<p>Our laboratory works on fundamental artificial intelligence and machine learning problems, in particular generalisability (through transfer learning, meta-learning, zero-shot learning, and few-shot learning), generative models, and explainability. Our research is inspired from applications in computer vision, remote sensing, ubiquitous computing and ICT4D. The above image is a word cloud of the publications from the lab (courtesy: <a href="http://www.wordle.net/">wordle</a>)</p>
<h3>Prospective PhD and MS Research Students</h3>
<p>The lab is looking for students technically strong in Mathematics and Computer Science interested in the data science, machine learning, deep learning and allied areas. Prospective students must possess excellent programming and communication skills. Please contact if you are one of them. The lab is also interested in industry/health care related problems that can be solved using data science and machine learning techniques. Please reach out if you have an interesting problem.</p>
<h3>Summer Internship</h3>
<p>Students technically strong in Mathematics and Computer Science with an aptitude for data mining, ubiquitous computing and related fields may apply through the INSA SRF program. The lab will not be taking students outside this program and will not be able to respond to your individual queries.</p>
